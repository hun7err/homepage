<p>
Proffesionally I'm a 24 y/o programmer and student of the final year of Networking and Distributed Systems at the Pozna≈Ñ University of Technology.
</p>
<p>
As far as my hobbies are concerned, I'm a (sysadmin/gamedev/...) -wannabe that's interested in more different topics than even I might think of ad-hoc. I play saxophone as well and find piano the most interesting of all instruments, so might be I start learning it soon (actually, I do own an electronic piano).
</p>
<p>
Speaking of music, I enjoy a wide variety of genres, starting from classical music, through electronic music and ending on (heavy/black/death) metal. Music is music and splitting it into genres doesn't really make sense to me if it goes further than one level deep.
</p>
<p>
Oh, I nearly forgot to mention that I play games. Quite a lot of them if I find enough spare time.

Ever since I started my adventures with computers I've been - more or less - interested in programming.
