<p>
Hello, it's been a month since I wrote something here and I think you deserve some comments on what's going on as I feel like I didn't give some important things enough attention (including this site/blog/whatever you find it to be).
</p>
<p>
As of now I should be done with my exams, so starting from next week some of my projects should (hopefully) get reactivated. I've already started working on translating <a href="http://whatcanidoformozilla.org">What can I do for Mozilla</a> and I want to do more work on open-source projects.
</p>
<p>
You might have seen I've returned on GitHub pushing some projects (both university and private) and during next week I should clean up some repositories that I find obsolete. Among recent stuff you will find <a href="https://github.com/hun7err/ansible-playbooks">some playbooks for Ansible</a>, <a href="https://github.com/hun7err/Hive">a Docker clustering library/tool for Elixir</a> and <a href="https://github.com/hun7err/homepage">this homepage</a>. Of course there will be more if I find enough time to work on them.
</p>
<p>
In 2 weeks I will also start working on my master thesis, which (if nothing changes) will be an algorithm solving the Global Illumination problem in (quasi-) realtime. If possible, I will share at least the idea and some screenshots of a working application.
</p>
<p>
Next week should be a bit easier in terms of the work needed to be done, so I might add some new posts. See you around!
</p>
